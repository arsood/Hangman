Hangman
=======

This is a basic Hangman game built with Javascript. It uses a sort of library I made, which I called HANG. This program is being developed for teaching Javascript to kids and beginners.

The idea is that the student would write the JS code that calls on the library in the app.js file located in the js/ folder. This library uses a couple jQuery commands as well for further learning.
